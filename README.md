# DS Diabetes binary classification 

This repository contains an interactive app which allows you to predict whether a new patient has diabetes or not based on several features. The app is composed by a Postgres database to store the past and new registers, a Shiny dashboard to visualize some interesting distributions and data, and finally an API to communicate both previous elements. The solution can be deployed by Docker compose.
